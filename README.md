# PA-SIM-paper-and-pencil-game
Graph-based logic game, which consists of several game modes. Each game mode consists of a graph where it is represented with 6 vertices and each vertex is connected by an edge (complete graph). So each game mode aims to not make a triangle between the edges you choose.
